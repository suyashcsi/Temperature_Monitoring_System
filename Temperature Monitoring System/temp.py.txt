#Note: The above "sensor_value" is the raw temperature reading, obtained from the LM35 sensor. In case you want to convert this
 value to the temperature in degree Celsius, use the formula: 

Temperature=(100*sensor_value)/1024 
Where sensor_value is the variable in which data obtained from the LM35 sensor is stored.
